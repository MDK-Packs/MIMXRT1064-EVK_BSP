# NXP MIMXRT1064-EVK

## Overview

The i.MX RT1064 EVK is a 4-layer through-hole USB-powered PCB. At its heart lies the i.MX RT1064 crossover MCU, featuring NXPâ€™s advanced implementation of the Arm Cortex-M7 core. This core operates at speeds up to 600 MHz to provide high CPU performance and excellent real-time response.

## CMSIS-Drivers

This board support pack contains a CMSIS-Driver for the [VIO](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/develop/Driver/html/group__vio__interface__gr.html) interface. This is a virtual I/O abstraction for peripherals that are typically used in example projects. The **Blinky** example uses this interface to create a blinking light with the USER LED mounted on the board that can be controlled by the USER BUTTON (SW8).

| Virtual Resource  | Variable       | Physical Resource on MIMXRT1064-EVK |

## CMSIS-DAP Firmware

Make sure that you have updated your CMSIS-DAP firmware to the latest version. This makes the board compatible with [Keil Studio Cloud](https://keil.arm.com) that enables browser-based project creation and debugging.

Download the following CMSIS-DAP firmware from NXP: [DAPLink v0246](https://www.nxp.com/downloads/en/bsdl/lpc4322__mimxrt1064_evk_if_crc_20180810.bin)

**Flashing instructions for Windows users**

1. While holding down the boards reset button, connect the boards USB debug port to the computer. It should enumerate and mount as **MAINTENANCE**.
1. Drag-and-drop the firmware file onto the mounted drive.
1. Wait for the file copy operation to complete.
1. Power cycle the board. It will now enumerate and mount as DAPLINK or the name of the board.

**Flashing instructions for Linux users**

1. While holding down the boards reset button, connect the boards USB debug port to the computer. It should enumerate as MAINTENANCE.
1. In a terminal execute  
   `cp <path to firmware file> <MAINTENANCE> && sync`  
   *Note*: make sure to change MAINTENANCE to the name of the mount point of the drive on your system.
1. Power cycle the board. It will now enumerate and mount as DAPLINK or the name of the board.

**Flashing instructions for MAC users**

1. While holding down the boards reset button, connect the boards USB debug port to the computer. It should enumerate as MAINTENANCE.
1. In a terminal execute  
   `sudo mount -u -w -o sync /Volumes/MAINTENANCE ; cp -X <path to firmware file> /Volumes/MAINTENANCE/`  
   *Note*: If your drive does not mount as MAINTENANCE make sure to change this to match the name of the mounted disk attached to your system.
1. Wait for the file copy operation to complete.
1. Power cycle the board. It will now enumerate and mount as DAPLINK or the name of the board.

**Self-help for bricked boards**

NXP's application note [AN13206 - Modifying Debug Firmware on i.MX RT10xx Boards Featuring An LPC4322-based Debug Probe](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN13206.pdf) explains how to recover a bricked development board.
